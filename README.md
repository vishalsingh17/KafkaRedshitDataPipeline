### Agenda
This project mainly focuses on the integration of PySpark with Confluent Kafka and Amazon Redshift to perform ETL(Extract-Transform-Load) and ELT(Extract-Load-Transform) operations.

### Tech stack:
- Language: Python
- Package: Pyspark
- Services:Docker, Confluent Kafka, Amazon Redshift

### Amazon Redshift
Amazon Redshift is a fully managed petabyte-scale cloud data warehouse service.
Redshift Spectrum also runs SQL queries directly against structured or unstructured
data in Amazon S3 without loading them into the Redshift cluster. Redshift lets us run
complex, analytic queries against structured and semi-structured data, using
sophisticated query optimization, columnar storage on high-performance storage like
SSD, and massively parallel query execution. It is an OLAP solution to store petabytes
of information without owning Infrastructure (Paas).

### Confluent Kafka
Kafka is a distributed data storage designed for real-time input and processing of
streaming data. Streaming data is information that is continuously generated by
thousands of data sources, all of which transmit data records at the same time. A
streaming platform must be able to cope with the constant influx of data and process it
sequentially and progressively. Kafka efficiently stores records streams in the order in
which they were created. Kafka is most commonly used to create real-time streaming
data pipelines and applications that react to changing data streams. It mixes
communications, storage, and stream processing to enable both historical and real-time
data storage and analysis.
